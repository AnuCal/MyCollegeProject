       <p>Creativity inspires me! <br><br>
        Born and broughtup in India and now having spent over two decades in the beautiful state of California. I have cultivated a deep 
        appreciation for creativity and self expression through my hobbies. I find my joy and fullfillment in artistic pursuits like sketching,calligraphy, 
        painting, gardening, macro and still-life photography, and hiking.
        <br><br>
        During 2016, I took a break from my clinical coding job due to health issues(Thanks to the car accident caused by break failure!) and family commitments. This period provided me with an opportunity to  
        rehabilitate and pursue additional college coursework to facilitate my career transistion.
        <br><br>
        
        I strongly believe that a human mind should never stop learning. Driven by curiosity and thirst for knowledge, I consider myself a perpetual learner.
         My education background reflects multifaceted 
        approach, spanning from Bachelor's degree in Art to Associate degree in Health and Information Technology, and currently working 
        towards Information technology. With each qualification , I have broadened my horizons and deepened my understanding of the world 
        around me, enriching my life with invaluable experiences.
        <br><br>
        
        PROFESSIONAL SKILLS: My strength lies in acquiring new skills and adept problem solving. With more than 8 years of professional
         experience in large scale hospital, I have honed my abilities to excel in dynamic settings.<br><br>
         Currently, I am transistioning into Information Technology field, leveraging my proficiency in various areas including relational 
         database design, algorithm design and administration, SQL, HTML5, CSS3, project management, and Python. In addition to these, 
         I possess exhibited proficiency in Data analysis and abstraction, EHR systems, Cerner and Citrix platforms, ICD 10, ICD 9, CPT codes, 
         database management and business communications.
          <br><br>
          I am committed to continous learning and have plans to delve into JavaScript during the upcomming summer semester. My goal is to further
           enhance my skills and contribute to the IT domain.
