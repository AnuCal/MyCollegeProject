    <h2>Introduction</H2>
        <p>I am Anuradha Sinhmar and I am a passionate, hardworking & aspiring web developer. I have 
            over 10 years of work experience as a Healthcare data analyst/ Coder with Shriners Hospital
             for Children. While working at Shriners Hospital, I was responsible for coding complex cases
             related to orthopedic, congenital anomaly, burns, plastic surgery/reconstruction, and 
             craniofacial anomalies. I was always fascinated by the medical field but more than that 
             I discovered that I wanted challenge and variety in my work. I have strong expertise in data
              management, report generation, and Data abstraction. I have successfully assisted my managers 
              to troubleshoot various issues when it came to tasks related to large 
             data sets. Microsoft Excel and database has been my strength as it allowed me to identify problems and 
             provide a solutions when needed. 
        </p>


    <H2>Education and Career Plans</H2>
        <p>I have a bachelors degree in Arts, Associate's Degree in Health and Information Technology and a working experience
             in Health care field. I had to leave my job due to health issues as a result of a car accident. While away from work I took numerous physical 
             therapy sessions to get strong and in addition I revamped my skills by completing additional classes on topics like SQL, Excel, Database Management, Oracle 
             database design concepts, and Computer designs/ problem-solving from Community college(Crc, Arc and Scc). I am currently enrolled at Los Rios 
             Community college in Project management and technology, and Introduction to Web Development coding HTML and CSS. Career transistions are tough but
              fun! I am a creative person and love to see my imagination come to life. CSS is my favourite because it allows me that <i>creative flexibility</i>.
